# zCompose
## A Docker Compose library in Zig

I've been trying to learn [zig](https://ziglang.org/) and since there's no better way of learning that doing something useful (cough, cough), I thought I would try to implement the [compose spec](https://compose-spec.io/) using zig ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Zig Ivan's reference library for parsing and loading Compose files as specified by the [Compose specification](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec).
